As shown in @tbl-summarytable, plastic waste data from 165 countries is grouped by coastal risk level.

Very High risk countries have the lowest waste per person (33.68 kg), but they still produce the second-largest total waste (2.52 million tonnes), likely due to large populations.Medium risk countries have the highest plastic waste per person (163.46 kg) and also the highest total waste (2.94 million tonnes). This means people in these countries use a lot of plastic, and the overall burden is also high.High risk countries show medium levels of waste per person (89.67 kg), but they have the lowest average recycling rate (5.50%) and the largest difference in total waste between countries (standard deviation of 7.44).Low risk countries produce the smallest amount of total waste (0.97 million tonnes), have more similar waste levels across countries (standard deviation of 1.30), and the highest recycling rate (19.66%).

This shows that coastal waste risk is not simply based on how much waste each person produces. Other factors, like population size and waste system quality, also play an important role.
