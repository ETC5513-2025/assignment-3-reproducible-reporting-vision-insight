# Discussion, Conclusion and Recommendations

## Discussion & Conclusion

This study shows that we canâ€™t fully understand coastal plastic pollution just by looking at how much waste people generate or how much gets recycled. We also need to consider consumption habits and how effectively each country manages its waste.

 - The Effect of Tourism: Many countries with high plastic waste per person are small islands, such as Iceland and Malta. These places actually recycle quite well. For example, Iceland has the highest plastic waste per person, but also a high recycling rate. This means that the real problem may not be poor waste services, but more waste caused by tourists. In the Maldives, for example, tourists create about five times more waste than local people. Even if the recycling system works well, it is hard to deal with the large increase in waste during busy travel seasons.

 - The Role of Population Density: Very High risk countries may have low waste per person, but their total waste is still high. This is because many people live close together, and waste services are often weak. When millions of people each produce a little plastic waste, the total amount becomes very large.

 - Differences in Waste Control: Medium and High risk countries show big differences between each other. Some countries pollute much more than others. This makes it harder to plan and manage resources. On the other hand, Low risk countries have more stable systems. They recycle more and have less difference between countries. These countries can be good examples for others to follow.

## Recommendations

 - Improve Waste Management in Tourist Areas: In countries that receive many tourists, it is important to have special plans for busy seasons. Governments can charge a small environmental fee to visitors to help pay for waste services. Shops should be encouraged to use less single-use plastic. Hotels and tourist spots should be required to sort and recycle their waste properly.

 - Focus on Areas with High Population: In places where many people live close together, it is more helpful to improve waste collection and treatment instead of only focusing on recycling. For example, cities can place smart bins on streets or use mobile waste trucks to reach crowded areas more easily and keep the environment clean.

 - Help Countries That Struggle and Share Good Ideas: Some countries in the Medium and High Risk groups have more trouble managing plastic waste. These countries should receive more support through better rules and stronger recycling programs. At the same time, countries that already have good systems can share their experience so that others can learn and use the same methods in their own way.
