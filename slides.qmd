## Problem Introduction

-   Plastic waste is a growing threat to both land and marine ecosystems.
-   Many countries generate high levels of plastic but lack efficient recycling systems.
-   Coastal regions are especially vulnerable to plastic leakage into oceans.
-   We aim to identify key risk factors and regional disparities in plastic waste patterns.

## Dataset Description

**Dataset:** Plastic Waste Around the World

**Coverage:** - This dataset includes data for 165 individual countries

**Key Variables:**

-   Total plastic waste generated (in metric tonnes)

-   Per capita plastic waste (in kilograms)

-   National recycling rate (in percentage)

-   Coastal plastic waste risk level

**Source:** The dataset is retrieved from a publicly available GitHub repository called **Pranu580** that compiles plastic waste statistics from multiple global environmental datasets.

##  Methods

-   Clean the data and remove missing values
-   Divided recycling rates into Low, Medium, and High groups
-   Estimated population and calculated waste per person
-   Grouped the data by coastal risk level and recycling category

## Top 10 Countries by Per Capita Waste

![Figure Shown: Horizontal bar chart](Figures/Figure1.png){width=60%}

-   Countries: Iceland, Malta, Cyprus, Palau, etc.
-   High per capita waste in tourist-heavy nations
-   Color-coded by recycling category (green, orange, red)

## Waste vs. Recycling Rate

-   Scatter plot with linear trend line
-   Weak inverse relationship: more waste often correlates with lower recycling
-   Key insight: High waste â‰  High recycling

---

## Results

Based on the analysis methods above, we found that small tourist-heavy island nations, like Iceland and Malta, tend to have the highest plastic waste per person, and that countries generating more waste often have lower recycling rates.

To better summarize these findings, we created the @tbl-summarytable below.

```{r}
#| label:  tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Plastic Waste Indicators by Coastal Risk Level"
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
 
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)



# Read the CSV file using a relative path
plastic_data <- read_csv("data/Plastic Waste Around the World.csv")

# Clean column names (convert to lower case with underscores)
plastic_data <- clean_names(plastic_data)

# Group by coastal risk level and calculate summary statistics
summarytable <- plastic_data %>%
  group_by(coastal_waste_risk) %>%
  summarise(
    `Per_WasteKG` = mean(per_capita_waste_kg, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Total_WasteMT` = mean(total_plastic_waste_mt, na.rm = TRUE),
    `SD(Total)` = sd(total_plastic_waste_mt, na.rm = TRUE),
    `Mean Recycling(%)` = mean(recycling_rate, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  arrange(match(coastal_waste_risk, c("Very_High", "High", "Medium", "Low")))  

# Display the table with two decimal places
kable(summarytable, digits = 2, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 24)

## Plastic Waste Indicators by Coastal Risk Level

![](table/Table1.png)

Coastal plastic pollution is not just about per-person use, but also tourism, population density, and waste system quality.
---
## Conclusion & Recommendations

-   **Tourism impact**: In island countries, high waste per person often comes from tourists, not poor systems. For example, in the Maldives, tourists make 5 times more waste than locals.Prepare for busy seasons; use eco-fees and make sure hotels sort waste properly.

-   **Population density**: Crowded places make a lot of total waste, even if each person only makes a little. Weak waste systems can't handle it well.Spend money on better waste collection (like mobile bins), not just recycling.

-   **Control variation**: Waste rules are very different in Medium and High risk countries. Low risk countries usually have steady and efficient systems.Help High risk countries improve, and share good ideas from Low risk countries.
