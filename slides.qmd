## Problem Introduction

-   Plastic waste is a growing threat to both land and marine ecosystems.
-   Many countries generate high levels of plastic but lack efficient recycling systems.
-   Coastal regions are especially vulnerable to plastic leakage into oceans.
-   We aim to identify key risk factors and regional disparities in plastic waste patterns.

## Dataset Description

**Dataset:** Plastic Waste Around the World

**Coverage:** - This dataset includes data for 165 individual countries

**Key Variables:**

-   Total plastic waste generated (in metric tonnes)

-   Per capita plastic waste (in kilograms)

-   National recycling rate (in percentage)

-   Coastal plastic waste risk level

**Source:** The dataset is retrieved from a publicly available GitHub repository called **Pranu580** that compiles plastic waste statistics from multiple global environmental datasets.
