## Problem Introduction

-   Plastic waste is a growing threat to both land and marine ecosystems.
-   Many countries generate high levels of plastic but lack efficient recycling systems.
-   Coastal regions are especially vulnerable to plastic leakage into oceans.
-   We aim to identify key risk factors and regional disparities in plastic waste patterns.

## Dataset Description

**Dataset:** Plastic Waste Around the World

**Coverage:** - This dataset includes data for 165 individual countries

**Key Variables:**

-   Total plastic waste generated (in metric tonnes)

-   Per capita plastic waste (in kilograms)

-   National recycling rate (in percentage)

-   Coastal plastic waste risk level

**Source:** The dataset is retrieved from a publicly available GitHub repository called **Pranu580** that compiles plastic waste statistics from multiple global environmental datasets.

##  Methods

-   Data cleaning with janitor, filtering missing values
-   Binned recycling rate into Low, Medium, High (using quantiles)
-   Derived population estimates and waste-per-person metrics
-   Grouped by coastal risk and recycling category

## Top 10 Countries by Per Capita Waste

![Figure Shown: Horizontal bar chart](Figures/Figure1.png){width=60%}

-   Countries: Iceland, Malta, Cyprus, Palau, etc.
-   High per capita waste in tourist-heavy nations
-   Color-coded by recycling category (green, orange, red)

## Waste vs. Recycling Rate

-   Scatter plot with linear trend line
-   Weak inverse relationship: more waste often correlates with lower recycling
-   Key insight: High waste â‰  High recycling
